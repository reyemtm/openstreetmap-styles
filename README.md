# openstreetmap-styles
A collection of desktop basemap styles for OpenStreetMap.

### OSM Light
An OSM style for ArcGIS Pro based on the Geofabrik shapefiles. The labeling is exaggerated (a bit large) since this style is being used for simple print maps, not web maps.

*This is a work in progress.*
