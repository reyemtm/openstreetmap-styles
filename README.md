# openstreetmap-styles
A collection of desktop basemap styles for OpenStreetMap. ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Pro or QGIS styles/contributions welcome.

### OSM Simple Light
An OSM style for ArcGIS Pro based on the [Geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america.html) shapefiles. It needs a better name, but this will do for now. The labeling is exaggerated (a bit large) since this style is being used for simple print maps, not web maps.
